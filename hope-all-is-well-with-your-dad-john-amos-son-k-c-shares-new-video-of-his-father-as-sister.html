Shares New Video of His Father as Sister</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>“Good Times” actor <a href=#>John Amos</a> and his two adult children, Kelly “K.C.” Amos and Shannon Amos, have been involved in a messy family spat since June. It all began with Shannon’s claims that the beloved entertainer was a victim of elder abuse and financial exploitation.</p><p>Shannon has never directly named her younger brother as being the “<a href=#>caregiver</a>” who mistreated her father in the GoFundMe <a href=#>account</a> she helped set up in his name, and neither has he accused her. The account was later deactivated.</p><p>However, K.C. was recently arrested and released on bail for <a href=#>allegedly making terroristic threats</a> toward his sister by sending videos and photos with guns on July 19. This came weeks after she had him <a href=#>removed</a> as medical power of attorney for the “Roots” star. Now, both of his children have spoken out in their own separate “weird” posts on social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Collage-Maker-14-Jun-2023-01-44-AM-6073-600x338.jpg><p>Since his arrest weeks earlier, K.C. has only shared one Instagram post featuring a <a href=#>tribute</a> to late comedian and actor Paul Reubens, who passed away last week on July 30.</p><p>“I was just thinking about you. You’ve been quiet,” wrote one fan in his comment section. “So happy to see you posting. I hope you’re well.”</p><p>A second wrote, “Hi, KC, hope all is well with you and your dad.”</p><p>On the night of Aug. 3, he shared a video of the “Coming to America” star as he <a href=#>groomed</a> his father after a haircut. Amos appeared to look well with a head of gray hair, as he was very particular about how he wanted it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Shannon took a lengthier approach, sharing a long caption to reflect on the past few months. She was informed her father was hospitalized in Memphis in mid-May. At one point, her father denied his daughter’s allegations and accused her of “taking advantage” of him from a hospital bed.</p><p>“These past months have truly tested my strength and resilience as my family situation unfolded in the public eye, an excruciating journey for all of us,” Shannon began.</p><p>“Clickbait, lies, half-baked stories, and wild assumptions fuel news and social media feeds, feeding negativity and drama to a hostile collective consciousness.”</p><p>She continued, “Life’s challenges can either break us or make us stronger. After all, life is always life-ing, full of ups and downs, and even when we dig deep to muster strength, believing in the return of the sun’s shine can be difficult.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/daughterofgoodtimesactorjohnamos-600x349.png><p>Fans in her comment section also expressed concern and sent well-wishes to the entire Amos family.</p><p>“Praying for YOU and your Family”</p><p>“love you Shannon. Sending you & your family love & light.”</p><p>“Much love to you my sister. Your people know your character. Sending love, light and prayers for healing & reconciliation to you and your family. Happy Early Born Day to us.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This video breaks my heart.<br>Former <a href=#>@Chiefs</a> player and actor John Amos is currently in the hospital for some health issues but in this video he's speaking to his lawyer about elderly abuse from his daughter. <a href=#>#ChiefsKingdom</a><br>😔 she also made a post lying about him being in ICU <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZMYiSNvt7j</a></p>— Luci The Pitbull's Mom (@Ms_LilShadow) <a href=#>June 16, 2023</a></figure><p>Amos was transferred from the hospital to a recovery center in New Jersey. His longtime friend Joanna Wright reportedly was granted power of attorney, and she tried to stop the 83-year-old’s and K.C.’s exit from the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation.</p><p>In a viral video that circulated online, Wright can be heard <a href=#>refusing</a> to give up her status as requested by Amos, stating, “That wouldn’t be responsible of me, especially when I see what’s going on.”</p><p>“You need some help,” she told K.C., who was sitting next to Amos in a car. “Your father needs some help. This is dysfunctional. This is a fractured family.”</p><p>Amos is known to share fun-filled videos with his father on social media. However, his Instagram <a href=#>page</a> has been fairly silent for weeks thus far.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49xZmlsX5%2B8qbqMmqSoq12otaK6zailZqOTYq6zvsSsq2adnJmys3nAm6ysnV2Yv7q806KaZqifqMFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
