News talking about Rihanna and Hassan has surfaced online.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BvRsTVqhEMG/</p><p>In the clip, Morgan said the following: “Do I think Rihanna‘s worthy of somebody who has a billion dollars? Yes, I do. I think is he worthy of her is the question. I see an engagement, and I also see a baby probably. Not yet, ’cause she still wants to smoke a cigarette once in a while, but [I] definitely see an engagement and then baby in like, two years.”</p><p>Rihanna was quick to like the post — her way of letting her fans know that she is indeed eager to get married and have children.</p><p>A source told Hollywood Life: “Rihanna gets baby fever all the time, but she is hesitant to start her family for a lot of reasons. She loves holding babies and playing with them and has always wanted to be a mom, but mostly bad timing and a busy schedule are standing in her way. She used to think she had to be married to have kids and there was a time when she was young that she thought Chris [Brown] was going to be the father to her kids.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BvPPxk_hpwz/</p><p>Fans cannot stop talking about the cigarette part. One critic said: “Won’t last, she is too independent. You can’t tell her anything. There’s plenty of pics of Rihanna smoking a cigarette on vacation but okaaaay. 😂😂😂”</p><p>Another person claimed: “Is he worthy of our Rih is absolutely the question 💜💜💜. Rih x Bey x Bri happiness 💜💜💜. Truly deserves everything coming to her but I think after my years of hip work and motivation we deserve an album. She does smoke cigarettes yall act like yall know Rihanna more than these industry people. 🤣”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BvaE-UFA0jK/</p><p>A third commenter stated: “Rihanna is worth 300 million dollars, so she doesn’t need his money and if you condone men hitting women, you are sick. Right! Lol I mean I’m ready for my girl to get married and have babies & all….. but PRIORIES @badgalriri PRIORIES! 😭😭😭Give us a bomb azz album and a great tour. 😜😩🤞🏾”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Does this mean Chris Brown still has a chance to win her back?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeinrWius2aZKygkaeytHnHnqlmnqWpwrOxjKmjmqZdrLa1tIyhmKyrkaN6q63MnpylZaSdtrR51aKbnqddoraotNNmpaisXaW5pq3SnmScoKKewG6u0aiup2Via35zg5Zo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
