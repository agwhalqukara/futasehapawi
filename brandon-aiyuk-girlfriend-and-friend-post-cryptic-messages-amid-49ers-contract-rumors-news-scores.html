With additional context, it sounds as though he was frustrated with his usage in the Super Bowl and perhaps the entire postseason.</p><p>The 2020 first-round pick caught 75 passes for a career-high 1,342 yards along with seven touchdowns in the regular season. His 17.9 yards per catch were the second-most in the NFL behind the Pittsburgh Steelers' George Pickens.</p><p>Aiyuk only had nine receptions spread equally across San Francisco's three playoff games, though. In the Super Bowl, he hauled in three passes on six targets for 49 yards.</p><p>Emotions can always be a bit raw after losing such a big game, so cooler heads could prevail over the coming days and weeks. But Aiyuk's situation might bear monitoring given his contract situation.</p><p>Last spring, the 49ers picked up his fifth-year option, so he's due to collect a <a href=# rel=noopener>$14.1 million</a> salary for the 2024 season. It's not uncommon for a player to push for a new deal a year out from free agency, and it can be in a team's interest to prevent that player from hitting the open market.</p><p>Minnesota Vikings star Justin Jefferson, another member of the 2020 draft class, is facing the same situation, and his long-term future in Minneapolis is the subject of <a href=#>much discussion</a>.</p><p>Should Aiyuk and San Francisco begin to negotiate a new contract and those conversations hit a stalemate, the 25-year-old could become a clear trade candidate for teams looking to upgrade the passing game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYG5%2Fcn2Mm6mappSku26tyLKspGWXnr%2BtstGinKecXZa7pXnFq6CeppRivbC%2F02aaq7GgqbakecyeqqyZl5rAbq3MoptmbGmav7R5wqilraqRmMFuvtSmpqur</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
