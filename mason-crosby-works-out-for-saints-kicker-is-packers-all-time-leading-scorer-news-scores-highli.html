While he was never the best kicker in football—surprisingly, he hasn't made a single Pro Bowl in his career—he's renowned for his consistency while kicking through some difficult Green Bay weather conditions.</p><p>Crosby is the Packers' all-time leading scorer and holds the franchise record for most consecutive games played. He's 13th on the all-time list for most field goals in NFL history with 395.</p><p>After struggling throughout the 2021 season, the Colorado product bounced back with a stellar 2022. He knocked through 25 of his 29 field-goal attempts and didn't miss a single kick under 40 yards.</p><p>However, the two sides parted ways after the season, as Crosby was not brought back as a free agent. Green Bay eventually turned to Anders Carlson at the position. Carlson has made 15 of 19 kicks and 20 of 23 extra-point attempts this season.</p><p>While there had been some speculation about him retiring, he told <a href=# rel=noopener>Ryan Wood</a> of the <i>Green Bay Post-Gazette</i> he had no plans to do so.</p><p>Crosby's workout comes while Blake Grupe serves as New Orleans' current kicker. Grupe has made 24 of 30 field goals this season and all 19 of his extra points.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZmh9c4WMppisp55isLO70puwZq%2Bfp7i0ec6uq2aen6d6tK3Ip6usZZuesKyx0WagrGWglrCssdGsZJqknGLBqrnEZqOemZSeu6h50pymq52i</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
