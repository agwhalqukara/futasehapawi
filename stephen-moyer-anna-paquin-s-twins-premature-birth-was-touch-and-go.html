At the BAFTA TV Tea at SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills on Saturday, Sept. 21, Moyer shared an update with reporters about how his twins are developing and which milestones they are reaching after being <a href=#>born prematurely</a>.</p><p>"It's all so amazing and [they] had a tough start," he explained. "They were early and it was touch and go there for a while, and so anything is amazing. I was just saying they are spitting up their first solid food. It's fantastic."&nbsp;</p><p>The True Blood actor, 43, and his costar wife, 31, welcomed Charlie and Poppy in September 2012. "The babies were born a few weeks early, but are in good health and both Mom and Dad are overjoyed," a rep for the couple told Us at the time. (Moyer is also a father to two kids, Lilac, 11, and Billy, 13, from previous relationships.)</p><p>Moyer told reporters Saturday that he and Paquin, who wed in summer 2010, worried constantly about the health of their children after their premature birth. "It does consume your every thought," he shared. "Sometimes you cope with it very well and sometimes you don't. And sometimes you wake up and you're desperately terrified, you're so tired you can't [do] anything, so you just get through it like anyone else."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The twins recently celebrated their first birthday, and Moyer said, "There's still things every now and then, but they're pretty great."</p><p>But the HBO star said he doesn't want his children to grow up too fast.</p><p>"They're nuts," he said of their growing personalties. "I think Anna's very excited about them walking and I'm like, 'Just wait. Let them . . .' Our lives are over once that happens!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKqtnaCdsq95zKiwnqpdlruvrYypmKqtmaPAbrzRnqSarKWnsm7A1qKlrGWUmsOmuM6poKefXayyrbiMmp2tnaJiwbDBwqFkmqaUYrSwecGiqa2gXWd9cn%2BRbnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
