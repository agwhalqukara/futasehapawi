"The first meal of the day can help keep weight gain away, so don't skip breakfast to manage your weight," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Johns Hopkins Health</span></a><span>. "Breakfast-eating adults tend to get less fat and more fiber in their diets. Kids and teens who eat breakfast get more fiber, too."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/GettyImages-1372291920.jpg><p><span>Scarfone loves </span><span>acai bowls with peanut butter and granola. "Peanut butter's combo of fiber (about two grams per tablespoon) and protein (around four grams per tablespoon) packs a powerful appetite-suppressing punch," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Denver Health Medical Plan</span></a><span>. "Because peanut butter helps control appetite, it might not come as a surprise that it may help you slim down. Nut eaters tend to have a healthier body mass index (BMI) than nut skippers, according to research."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/GettyImages-1398744704.jpg><p><span>Scarfone insists the </span><i><span>Too Hot To Handle </span></i><span>cast enjoyed plenty of delicious food while filming. "We had a plethora of food," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I was eating so much, and we could have as many plates as we want…We had an open buffet, not to mention, we had a really amazing chef. I think the chef was Rihanna's chef. So we had the best food."</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/GettyImages-1370303772-rotated.jpg><p><span>Scarfone enjoys the occasional pizza, which can be a nutritious choice depending on ingredients and preparation. "Pizza is a staple in a lot of households," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Julia Zumpano, RD, LD</span></a><span>. "It can get a bad reputation as an 'unhealthy' food, but the great thing is that pizza can be modified easily to be better for your heart and still very satisfying. The No. 1 best way to boost the nutritional value of your pizza is by cutting out processed meats, which are high in calories and unhealthy fats."</span></p><p><span>Scarfone says her self-care routine on Too Hot To Handle was a challenge. "We had 30 minutes to get ready, and we all had to share one shower," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I genuinely had, like, 10 minutes to get ready each day. […] When I want[ed] to do my makeup I had to just throw it on. So it was a little bit of a challenge."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkoaecocZuv8KaqZ%2Bnnpp6qrqMm5itoJmjtG6%2F1KKrZqGjYrmqwNOlnGalmajAbr%2FUp6qhoZ6afA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
