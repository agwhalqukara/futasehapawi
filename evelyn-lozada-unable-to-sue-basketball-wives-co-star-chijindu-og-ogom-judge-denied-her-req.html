Previously, the judge and court had granted her a two-month time limit to facilitate the lawsuit, however, she hasn’t been able to contact Ogom. Back in 2019, Lozada filed a suit against her for the intentional infliction of distress in addition to defamation for suggesting she was racist online.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7KLvGDnOpl/</p><p>Reportedly, Ogom insinuated she was racist on social media. The Basketball Wives star claims she lost endorsement deals and also was the subject of online harassment. Ogom hasn’t responded to the suit yet, and it’s not looking like she will.</p><p>Back in December of 2019, Ricki Mathers reported that Evelyn took to her social media account to share a message after OG Chijindu talked badly about her online. Evelyn, who has two children, was baptized following a period of introspective self-reflection.</p><p>For that reason, she’s abstaining from sex until she gets married, and wants the portrayal of her reality-tv-persona to change. Fans of the show will remember when Lozada was accused of being a “colorist,” and Shaunie O’Neal was too.</p><p>Furthermore, she found herself in altercations that nearly turned physical with several of her co-stars. OG, on the other hand, sat down with hosts of a radio show in recent months and discussed Evelyn’s use of the n-word. Moreover, she addressed Lozada’s claim that she was afro-Latina.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Around that time, Evelyn released a video in which she stated there were times when the devil had a “sneaky, funny way,” of trying to throw a believer off their path. Lozada has a renewed sense of commitment to her faith.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeVq7Ktxc1mo6iykZmubsHNmpmlnV2pvG6%2F1J5km5mjoLK1rsClo2avmauytHnCqGSsrJGneqS0yKOgp5ylYryoec6gpqZlmqqxqLGMnZynoZWZeqmx0WapnqmlmsC1edOoZJyqlZbBpnnNnq6sqJGlsrN5wJ1kbG1pZYVzew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
