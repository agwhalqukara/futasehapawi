As All-NBA players, The Dallas Mavericks' Luka Dončić and Oklahoma City Thunder's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are eligible to sign supermax contracts.</p><p>ESPN's Bobby Marks provided their annual breakdowns should they get all of the money they're entitled to based on the salary cap projections:</p>Bobby Marks <span class=acct>@BobbyMarks42</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Luka Doncic is now eligible to sign a super max extension in the 2025 offseason.&lt;br>&lt;br>The extension is the largest contract in NBA history. &lt;a href="https://t.co/GBNUsABHH4">pic.twitter.com/GBNUsABHH4&lt;/a></p>Bobby Marks <span class=acct>@BobbyMarks42</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is now eligible to sign a super max extension in the 2025 offseason. &lt;br>&lt;br>He would be the first player to earn $80M+ in one season. &lt;a href="https://t.co/E5yHzGse3b">pic.twitter.com/E5yHzGse3b&lt;/a></p><p>Marks also noted Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton and Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards will both get a pay bump:</p>Bobby Marks <span class=acct>@BobbyMarks42</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tyrese Haliburton and Anthony Edwards have earned an extra $41M by their All-NBA selection. &lt;a href="https://t.co/eX51l11S6N">pic.twitter.com/eX51l11S6N&lt;/a></p><p>Never before has the max/supermax distinction carried more weight.</p><p>We haven't seen the full effects of the current collective bargaining agreement, yet it has already made a notable impact by restricting the highest-spending teams in the league.</p><p>The Phoenix Suns had few means by which they could improve their supporting cast around Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal, and their lack of depth played a role in their first-round sweep at the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves. The same was true for the Milwaukee Bucks.</p><p>General managers have to be even more judicious with how they manage the cap now, so the difference between having a star signed to a supermax deal instead of the regular max can be important.</p><p>In the cases of Gilgeous-Alexander and Dončić, you'd expect their situations to be relatively straightforward. They finished second and third respectively in the <a href=# rel=noopener>MVP voting</a> and they're both 25 years old. In terms of team success, the Thunder claimed the top seed in the Western Conference, while the Mavericks are in the Western Conference Finals for the second time in three seasons.</p><p>Oklahoma City and Dallas will have little choice but to at least table a supermax offer to their dynamic cornerstones. The intrigue comes with whether Gilgeous-Alexander and/or Dončić decide to leave some money on the table and if they don't how their teams build the roster moving forward.</p><p>The Thunder are in a particularly delicate position because their payroll is due to skyrocket in a few years.</p><p>Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams can become restricted free agents in 2026, while Gilgeous-Alexander and Luguentz Dort can hit the open market in 2027. Sooner or later Presti will cash in his <a href=# rel=noopener>draft picks</a> to acquire a star who raises OKC's ceiling, too, which will probably mean adding another max or supermax contract to the books.</p><p>Gilgeous-Alexander's All-NBA honor was well deserved and symbolizes the bright future ahead for the Thunder. But his supermax eligibility will make Presti's life a little more difficult.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmd%2Fdn2MpaykmV2ZvK%2BvyJxkrKCRnnqotcugnKito2KurbHXmqWdnaJivraty6KdsmWWpL9uv9SpnKulka16pLvNramam6SoeqK5yJ1kmqScYrujrYynpp2r</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
