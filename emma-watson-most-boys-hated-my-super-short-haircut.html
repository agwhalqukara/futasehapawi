There’s no two ways about it. The majority of the boys around me were like, ‘Why did you do that? That’s such an error.’ And I was like, ‘Well, honestly, I don’t really care what you think!’ I’ve never felt so confident as I did with short hair — I felt really good in my own skin.”</p><p>Watson, who grew up in front of the world as one of the stars of the mega successful Harry Potter film franchise, says her fashion sense is often criticized, too. “When I was younger, I used to do it all myself, but I’ve had to get help because it’s gotten to a stage where I can’t show up in my Converses or whatever I bought from High Street [in London],” she says of working with a stylist.</p><p>“And just practically, these gowns are ridiculous,” Watson adds. “You’re being photographed from every angle, so not only do you have to consider how the thing looks, but whether you’re&nbsp; going to be able to sit in it and whether people are going to be able to see up your skirt.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=635 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Emma Glamour Cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Though Watson is used to being in the spotlight, she’s not always aware of her own fame. When she was photographed making out with Brown University student <strong>Will</strong> <strong>Adamowicz</strong> at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California, in April, Watsn was mortified.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My friend got me tickets for my birthday, and what am I going to say? No, I’m not going to go, because I don’t want to be photographed? But it was a huge crowd, and I thought there was no way anyone could get pictures of me, but somehow they found me,” sighs Watson, who is still dating Adamowicz. “It’s difficult on my dating life, because anyone I get photographed with is automatically my boyfriend. So&nbsp; it just makes it look as if I’ve had, like, 6,000 boyfriends!”</p><p>Rumors about her love life aside, Watson is eager to show fans a different side of her in the upcoming movie Perks of Being a Wallflower, based on the popular 1999 novel by <strong>Stephen</strong> <strong>Chbosky</strong>.</p><p>“Making this movie was so pivotal for me because I realized I do really want to be an actress, which wasn’t something I fully knew, since Harry Potter was such a singular experience,” Watson tells <a href=#>Glamour</a>. “Obviously I’m nervous to see what other people think, but it kind of doesn’t matter to me. It’s so cheesy to say this, but it’s the journey, not the end goal, that’s important.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmZ6ZpanGcLrEsKponZ2irm7DwK2qqKZdory0wIybprKrXZ2utbHDZqSyZaOqvaa%2BjKyfqKqkYrWitdGcrK1lYmV%2Bc4CY</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
