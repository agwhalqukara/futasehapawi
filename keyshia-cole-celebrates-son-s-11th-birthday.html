The celebrity mom took to Instagram to commemorate the day.</p><p>“Happy BDay to my Big boy,” <a href=#>Keyshia</a> exclaimed online. “@daniel_gibsonjr THE BIG 11,” the celebrity mom further doted. “I love you, boo,” Cole wrote to her son. “Proud to call you my son, and you’re the best big brother to @tobiaskhale. Unconditional love is the BEST LOVE.”</p><p>Daniel is Keyshia Cole’s oldest son. The celebrity mom welcomed her first child months before marrying Daniel’s father, Daniel Gibson Sr., in 2010. The marriage between Daniel Sr. and Keyshia did not last as the couple finalized their divorce last September after years of separation. Keyshia and Daniel, however, maintain a strong and healthy friendship that leads to excellent co-parenting.</p><p>Some may remember when Keyshia let <a href=#>her ex-husband</a> live with her for a time in 2017. A few questioned Cole’s motivation for such a high level of generosity. The singer opened up about her reasoning during an interview with Daily Pop.</p><p>“Daniel is going through some financial things and I feel like you know what – we still … we’re co-parents,” Keyshia said. “At the end of the day, if I can help, I would want him to do it for me if I were in that predicament,” she added. “And all that matters is that DJ is there with them and we get to see him.”</p><p><a href=#>Keyshia and Daniel’s living situation</a> was aired on Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood (LHHH). The celebrity mom at the time was in the middle of creating new music, which meant she needed to be away from home more often. Daniel living in the home turned out to be a sort of saving grace as Keyshia did not need to hire a babysitter for their son.</p><p>Keyshia Cole is the proud mom of two kids. The celebrity mom’s youngest son, Tobias Khale, celebrates his second birthday in August.</p><p>Photo: Keyshia Cole/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWpmaWtfZYFwt8SyqqGhkWKwsLjEZpqepJWXv6LAxKxkrKeeqHpyfdOhZJuhoqm1pa3YaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
