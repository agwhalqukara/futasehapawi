Sharon Osbourne, while stoking the flames of the RHOA feuds, told NeNe that she thought a “nasty girl” was jealous of her.</p><p>Without NeNe, Sharon argued, there simply wasn’t a show. According to Leakes, she has to watch the other episodes first and also has to make sure that “nasty girl” won’t be saying mean things that she shouldn’t be saying.</p><p>https://youtu.be/yXa12YgkoGo</p><p>According to BET, “nasty girl” is referring to NeNe’s co-star, Kenya Moore. The outlet explained that much of Season 12 has been very dramatic for NeNe, who has fought with other women while also trying to repair her damaged friendship with Cynthia Bailey, who was once her best friend.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ricki Mathers reported on comments made by NeNe Leakes,</a> including when she accused Kenya Moore of having a “stank attitude.” NeNe stated that Kenya’s attitude and disposition towards others would be the end of the series if she kept it up.</p><p>Leakes argued that Kenya is always telling her that no one likes her, but in actuality, no one likes her. Regarding what she intends to do in the future, NeNe has a variety of entrepreneurial endeavors she has been working on over the years.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It goes without saying that NeNe will surely find something else to do once she finally leaves Real Housewives of Atlanta.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeemrumecuemKSdo2KyubzLmqCnq12stbp50qGcZqSZoLKtxYywpqesXZi8rrGMm5ico12pvG6%2Bx6iYZmtnZn5xgI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
