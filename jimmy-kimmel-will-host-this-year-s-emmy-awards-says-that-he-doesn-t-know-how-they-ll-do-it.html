On Tuesday morning, it was revealed by the network that Kimmel would host the show for the third time.</p><p>It comes just a day after the Television Academy revealed the Creative Arts Ceremonies would be going virtual. Reportedly, Kimmel said that he doesn’t know how they’re going to go about it or why they’re doing it, but regardless, he’ll be the host.</p><p>Furthermore, it was reported by Billboard that the television talk show host will also executive produce the event. In a statement, Karey Burke said that Jimmy will undoubtedly deliver an entertaining and “moving” performance.</p><p>Reportedly, ABC has had to move around many different awards shows on account of the coronavirus pandemic. For instance, the 2021 Oscars have been pushed to the 25th of April.</p><p>Kimmel has also been hosting ABC’s reboot of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, in addition to his late-night television show from the comfort of his own home since March of this year. Fans of the talk show host know that he’s not the only one to do so either.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B_DIfRXlIOA/</p><p>Other hosts including Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, and Wendy Williams have had to conduct their regular programming from their houses. While the effort to adapt to the changing circumstances was hailed by the mainstream media, many social media users were less forgiving.</p><p>One user on Twitter said that “late-night TV’s loss of writers, production sets, and other employees has really shown us just how unfunny many of these hosts are.” Others, however, argued that they were just as good as usual, but minus the production quality.</p><p>As it was previously reported, much of Hollywood and the entertainment industry had to either shut down their productions completely or postpone them to later in the year once the coronavirus began sweeping across the United States, especially in New York City.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>NBCUniversal, for example, had to shut down over 30 different productions amid the pandemic, and release for films such as No Time To Die were also postponed.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeanrquxYykoKallaF6uLXLpWShp6OperW0yKxksp2Rp8BuscymsGaZp5a%2Fpb%2BMrJiyq12ptaLAjKGcZpyfmsCvwIykpaivXZ28uHnToZyypJxisbB5yK1kbWhmbYV3ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
