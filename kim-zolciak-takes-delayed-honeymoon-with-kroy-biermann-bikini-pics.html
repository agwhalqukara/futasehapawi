The Bravo reality star took a delayed honeymoon with football player husband<strong> Kroy Biermann</strong> in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico this week — three years after their TV wedding. "Being on vacation is hard work," the mother of six wrote on Instagram over the July 4th weekend.</p><p>"We are finally on our 'honeymoon' almost four years later, four kids later and five years of utter bliss!" Zolciak, 37, wrote. "A vacation isn't really a vacation when you are a mommy/daddy. I have spent more time on FaceTime with my kids than the beach. I miss them so very bad! Hopefully this piña colada will help me to relax."</p><p>During their stay, Zolciak and Atlanta Falcons player Biermann — who married in a Don’t Be Tardy . . . special episode in 2011 — kept in touch with their kids, Brielle, Ariana, KJ, Kash, and twins&nbsp;Kaia&nbsp;and Kane — through video chat. "Oh how I miss them," she said of her kids, using the hashtag #blessed.</p><p><a href=#>Anybody that knows me knows "FootPrints" (In the Sand) is my favorite poem EVER ???? Always has been.. I took this picture yesterday of Kroy and while I'm sitting here drinking my coffee I came across this pic. Unbelievable to me it totally reminds me of my favorite poem. I'm feeling so blessed. I'm hopping off social media so I can enjoy the "moments" Here is the poem: ???? As I was walking along the beach with my Lord. Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life. For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand, One belonging to me and one to my Lord. After the last scene of my life flashed before me, I looked back at the footprints in the sand. I noticed that at many times along the path of my life, especially at the very lowest and saddest times, there was only one set of footprints. This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it. "Lord, you said once I decided to follow you, You'd walk with me all the way. But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life, there was only one set of footprints. I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me." He whispered, "My precious child, I love you and will never leave you Never, ever, during your trials and testings. When you saw only one set of footprints, It was then that I carried you."</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A photo posted by Kim Zolciak-Biermann (@kimzolciakbiermann) on Jul 6, 2015 at 8:22am PDT</p><p>While in paradise, Zolciak did have one minor snafu — but managed to escape a bikini wardrobe malfunction. Instead, the busy mom was attacked in the ocean. "Isn't Cabo amazing? These rocks were cool until a million crab came running out!" recalled Zolciak. "I never ran so fast in all my life."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKKipV2vvK2vyJqiZqyRoLK0ecOeo5qxlZl6qbvNnrCmp5%2Bjeri106FkpKqfrnqjtcSrpJqmnmKvqrfIp6BmqJmYwG5%2Bj2pscW8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
