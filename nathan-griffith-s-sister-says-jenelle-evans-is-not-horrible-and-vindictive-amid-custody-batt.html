The woman chatted with HollywoodLife and showed her full support to Jenelle Evans instead of her own brother, arguing that the former Teen Mon star is a great mother.</p><p>Heather Griffith defended Jenelle and made it very clear that she wishes more people realized the reality TV celeb is doing a good job parenting her kids.</p><p>Nathan’s sibling also told the same news outlet all about how Jenelle coped with losing her kid for a few weeks in the aftermath of her husband David Eason shooting her dog.</p><p>‘I think a lot of things have been exaggerated and blown out of proportion. I don’t see Jenelle as an unfit parent or someone that doesn’t love her kids. I watch her go through this process, and she’s tried to remain so positive but she was just so sad,’ Heather stated.</p><p>She went on to share that ‘After getting to know her over the past few months — we recently became closer when the kids were taken away — I don’t see her as this horrible, vindictive person that she’s constantly being played out to be. I think she is just constantly under attack and I don’t think that she’s unfit as a parent.’</p><p>As fans remember, Jenelle and David were able to bring the kids back home after a judge ruled in their favor on July 4.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>However, her custody fight is not over because Nathan is working on appealing the result and even getting primary custody since he believes that ‘with her situation [he] would be more fit as a parent.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeelsGprc1mnquhlpu2tbTSZqqiq6Sav26%2FwLKqZqKVo7KtuMRmnK%2BZnqh6qr%2BMp6atZZikv7O1waWcZpmemXq3tc2doJysmauybq3Moptmm6WowbCw2GaZmqykobJuf49qaGtrXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
