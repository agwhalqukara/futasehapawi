The producer has gifted Wendy Williams with a $40,000 watch.</p><p>The Frank Muller timepiece was customized and purchased from Flawless Jewelry where sources say that he is a regular.</p><p>An insider told E! Online: “Kevin comes in and sees Eddie from Flawless for pretty much all of his jewelry needs. Kevin is a regular at the jewelry store, he’s been a customer there for years and years. I don’t know if he picked up anything else while he was at the shop.”</p><p>[media-credit name=”Source: E!

He’s <a href=#>rumored to be controlling</a> and manipulative which makes Williams so hesitant to leave him for good.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The sources close to the situation feel as though in order for Wendy to become mentally and physically healthy — she’s got to give him the boot. Do you believe Hunter had a motive behind gifting the talk show host with this icy watch?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmsOquoyhrKeslad6tLzOoqOsZaeau6XFjLCgpaSZlrq0edaiq6FlZGV9cXyMsJitm5hiwaK4yqxkmpqfqsFusdKtqZqml5qxbsPIn5ysZaOkr7O1xK2wZmpman56fI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
