Like an angel peeking into the van through the roof,” another wrote.</p><p>A third commented: “Oh wow, that’s awesome.”</p><p>Petito, the 22-year-old Long Island native whose remains were discovered in a Wyoming park on Sept. 19, has been identified with angels since her death, which has been ruled a homicide.</p><p>During a trip two years ago, she stopped in Colorado Springs, where she posed in front of a colorful mural of wings painted by a local artist. She shared that iconic image on Instagram in October 2019.</p><p>The day her remains were found, her father, Joseph, shared the image again, writing, “She touched the world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/petito-van-angel-preview-2.jpg><p>And a mural featuring the same words above a painting of a winged Petito has been drawn in her hometown of Blue Point on Long Island, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Greater Long Island</a>.</p><p>“I was nervous that I’d struggle to capture her, but I did it,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tess Parker</a>, 30, who painted the eight-foot-tall rendition, told the news outlet on Tuesday. “I’m happy with it so far, and it’s getting a lot of good feedback from the community.</p><p>“As long as the Petito family is happy with this, then I am happy with this. If they got upset and said they didn’t like it, I’d immediately paint right over it.
