Despite not marrying and separating later, her parents never compromised when raising Emily. She is very close to her father, and they have been sighted together at many events. Emily is currently pursuing her studies in high school and loves horseback riding.</p><p>As of 2021, there is no information about Emily’s physical appearance, such as her height or weight.

Maria Fernanda, Emily’s eldest half-sister, is also the youngest among Canelo’s children.

Her family ties are strong, and her interest in horseback riding shows her love for animals and the outdoors. We look forward to seeing more of Emily and her family.</p><h2 class="kt-adv-heading_76d419-75 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_76d419-75>Family</h2><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_a69370-13 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_a69370-13>Parents</h3><p>Emily Cinnamon Alvarez is the daughter of <strong>Karen Beltran</strong> and Mexican professional boxer Canelo Alvarez.
