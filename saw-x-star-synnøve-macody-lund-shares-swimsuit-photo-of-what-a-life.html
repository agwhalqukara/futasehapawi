In a recent social media post the Saw X star shows off her amazing body at 47 in a swimsuit. "Thank you for all the lovely birthday greetingsüå∏ I have mostly celebrated this myself. What a year, what a life, what a love," she captioned the Instagram post. How does the star manage to look half her age and what are her secrets to happiness? Celebwell rounded up her top lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Synn√∏ve enjoys long walks on the beach. "Learning lines in the remains of summer. Danish beaches‚Ä¶I could get lost in you," she captioned a post. Going for a daily walk can be a game changer in terms of exercise, especially at a brisk speed. One study published in </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>JAMA Internal Medicine</span></a><span> found that walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day led to a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death, compared with walking a similar number of steps but at a slower pace.</span></p><p><span>Synn√∏ve drinks red wine. "Red wine, in moderation, has long been thought of as heart healthy," says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span>. "The alcohol and certain substances in red wine called antioxidants may help prevent coronary artery disease, the condition that leads to heart attacks."</span></p><p><span>Synn√∏ve swims. "It's on," she captioned this snap. Swimming is a good way to get regular aerobic physical activity, according to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>CDC</span></a><span>. Just two and a half hours per week of aerobic physical activity, such as swimming, bicycling, or running, can decrease the risk of chronic illnesses. In addition to the many physical benefits, there are multiple studies supporting the mental health benefits of swimming as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Synn√∏ve has a bad habit. "I have to smoke, me. I'm such a morning smoker," she confessed to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Universitas</span></a><span> in an interview.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/shutterstock_2008335941.jpg><p><span>Synn√∏ve enjoys drinking "cold chamomile tea," she told Universitas. "But when it's Friday, I drink some gin. My friends call it a 'Macody' ‚Äì cold chamomile tea with ice cubes and gin." Numerous </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>studies</span></a><span> have shown that a variety of teas may boost your immune system, fight off inflammation, and even ward off </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>cancer</span></a><span> and </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>heart disease</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Synn√∏ve does detoxes. When she is on them she gives up coffee. According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cleveland Clinic</span></a><span>, there are several benefits of drinking coffee in moderation. "It </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>acts on your brain</span></a><span> to improve memory, mood, reaction times, and mental function," they say, citing a s</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>tudy</span></a><span> finding that caffeine can improve endurance and performance during exercise. It is also antioxidant-rich, can ward off diabetes, prevent neurologic disease, lower cancer risk, and ward off depression, they point out.</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifLSt1mavZquklr9uv9inpaiulWK6oq%2FOnbBmpKWjsW6%2Fx5qpnqtdqMSqudKuoK1loJ28tbuMqJ1mr5iWwW6tjKWgn51f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
