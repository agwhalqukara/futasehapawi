Now pregnant with the couple's first child and planning a wedding to her former That '70s Show costar, the Jupiter Ascending actress, 30, says she changed her mind about saying "I do" when she met the right guy.</p><p>"I never wanted to get married. From the age of 12, I prepared my parents for no marriage," the engaged mom-to-be told <a href=#>W magazine</a> in an interview for its August issue. "Then things changed — I found the love of my life. Now my theory on weddings is: Don't invite anyone. Do it privately and secretly. My parents are okay with that. They're just excited that I said yes."</p><p>Kunis is excited, too, in spite of her past reservations about tying the knot. "We all get movie star crushes," she shared with the mag. "I'm marrying mine."</p><p>Kutcher wasn't just Kunis' crush, though — he was also her first kiss. The two initially met as costars on That '70s Show back in 1998, when the actress was just 14 or 15 years old. "My first real kiss ever was with him on the show," she recalled to W. "And when That '70s Show had a prom, my date for the prom turned out to be my fiance. We can honestly say that we went to prom together." <a href=#>Check out Mila and Ashton's cutest couple moments</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She joked, however, that she "went home with someone else" at the end of the episode. "We don't talk about that part," she quipped. (In fact, her character, Jackie, started prom with Hyde but got back together with Kutcher's Kelso that night.)</p><p>For that reason, among others, That '70s Show holds a special place in the Black Swan star's heart. "Not only did it introduce me to my fiance, but I'm so grateful that all my mistakes are recorded for posterity," she explained. "I went through everything embarrassing that a girl can go through in front of my fiance. There's no question that he's seen the worst. I find that comforting."</p><p>These days, the lovebirds are busy preparing for first-time parenthood — and Kunis couldn't be more thrilled. "I have never wanted to be the person who only has business on her mind. To me, this job has always been a hobby that turned into a great profession, but I don't eat and breathe acting," she told W. "I'm sure Meryl Streep has a very different point of view. But I'm excited about being a full-time mom."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSipJFiuLa6yKxkqKZdnbKzedaem52hnpx6tbuMmqqhrJ%2BjeqzB05yfnqpdl7KqusZmmGaepaG5bsDIppxmpZ%2Biem5%2Bj2prcG8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
