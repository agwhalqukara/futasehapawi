According to reports, Bieber was charged with criminal vandalism yesterday. It’s unsure as to whether or not the charges will be a misdemeanor or a felony, but the prosecutor who investigated the case seems to believe it’s a no-brainer – “If this isn’t a felony, nothing is”. Bieber’s fun night of egging reportedly cost an estimated $20k in damages. The case has been sent to the top level lawyers in the D.A.’s office for a final decision.</p><p>Apparently, Bieber has been keeping the D.A.’s office pretty busy. They were also investigating the embattled pop star for an incident at batting cage in which a woman alleged that he verbally abused her and took her cell phone. There doesn’t seem to be enough evidence in that case to make a move on Bieber, but the egging case is doomsday for him. There’s video of evidence of him involved in the incident that implicates him. The question now remains will it be a felony or misdemeanor?</p><p>At what point is Bieber going to land behind bars?</p><p>Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGihrquknrtursiemZ6qXZi1or7Gnptmm6Keuqq6wKVkr5mema6ttdKmZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
