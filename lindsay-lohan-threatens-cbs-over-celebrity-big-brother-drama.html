The 32-year-old star joked on her Instagram, “CBS, Big Brother, you suck and get no Valentine’s from Lohan Beach Club.”</p><p>On the 14th of February, Lohan said that her mother was an amazing person and she did great while on the show. The Mean Girls alum added that she had some information which would “expose” everyone there, and Lindsay hash-tagged the post with her mother’s name.</p><p>As it was previously reported, Dina became the center of attention when she was working on the set of Celebrity Big Brother. The star admitted she hadn’t met or talked with her boyfriend in approximately five years, and her statement really surprised a lot of social media users.</p><p>On the February 7th episode, Dina told her housemates she had been talking to him for half-a-decade, and she couldn’t wait to tell everyone about it. According to a report from Us Weekly, she said to her housemates “You know when you talk to someone on the phone, like, you feel like you know them?”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt3_3R4BOGS/</p><p>Later on, it was revealed by the 56-year-old woman that her long-distance man was named Jesse Nadler, and he currently lives in San Francisco, while she lives on the other side of the United States in New York City. “I swear to you he’s real,” the reality star remarked.</p><p>Lindsay later took to her Instagram to express her blessings and excitement for her mother but joked that she hoped there wouldn’t be any more catfishes – or in other words, men who aren’t as attractive in real life as they are on social media.</p><p>Dina’s ex-husband, Mike, apparently approves of him and thinks Jesse is a great guy with a “good heart.” The 58-year-old said to reporters from Us Weekly on the 13th of February that Dina needs a person in her life she can really trust and put her faith in.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>These days, Dina’s daughter has been busy working on her nightclub reality series in Greece. Her venue has featured big stars including the ex-boyfriend of Kylie Jenner, Tyga.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecnrulv8CyZKWnmJa7bsDHq5yarJWjwG6vwaxkqK6Vp3qkscuemauhpK56o7XGZpmrp6SdsrN5w6uYppldZ4F3f5hsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
