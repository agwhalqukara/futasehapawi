The celebrity father recently took to social media to set the record straight.</p><p>“I’mma (sic) always love Lai Lai,” Fetty said during an Instagram Live recording this past weekend. “I was there when she was born,” the rapper added. “I was there for her doctor’s appointments. Me and her mother fell out but that ain’t got nothing to do with the baby.”</p><p>Although he serves as a father figure to little Alaiya, Fetty Wap made it clear on Instagram Live that he is not biologically related to Alexis Sky’s daughter. “When I feel like I want to be there, I’m going to be there,” Fetty told his social media fans. “I’m gonna help,” he added. “But as far as me going above my boundaries – nah. If it was biological with me, then it would be different.”</p><p>Fetty Wap has two sons, Zaviera and Aydin, and a daughter named Khari Barbie. Solo Lucci sparked rumors of Alaiya Grace being his daughter earlier this year. Alexis dismissed the notion with a now-deleted social media post in which she criticized Lucci for bringing such a notion to the public.</p><p>“I have been humiliated, I have been disrespected, I have been harassed none f—ing stop about not knowing who my child’s father all because of Michael Dorsey, a.k.a. Solo Lucci, continuing to spread this lie,” Alexis shared. “I have been bullied nonstop, but TODAY this s— ENDS,” the celebrity mom declared.</p><p>“I have never not known who my child’s father is,” Alexis wrote online. “I’ve been thru so much s—t because of this,” she added. “I have been called every disgraceful, disrespectful, hurtful word in the book. And It’s ashamed that I had to go out of my way JUST to prove this to society what I BEEN telling everyone.”</p><p>Alexis Sky previously uploaded evidence to dismiss the notion of Solo Lucci being the father of her child.
