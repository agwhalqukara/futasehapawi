Among the hijinks he pulled off during his trip with <strong>Kim</strong> and <strong>Rob Kardashian</strong>, <strong>Kanye West</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Cheban</strong>: He became British royalty in an authentic knighting ceremony after purchasing the title over the Internet.</p><p>“Whether it’s Sir Disick, Lord Disick, Count Disick — becoming royal is going to get me the respect I deserve,” Disick, 29, said prior to pledging his allegiance to the laws of England and Wales. “I don’t have to be walking around like some peasant. I’m royalty!”</p><p>While new dad Disick — his girlfriend <strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong> welcomed daughter Penelope Scotland July 8 — couldn’t get enough of his new title of Lord, travel buddy Rob Kardashian, 25, wasn’t impressed. “I can’t take Scott seriously — I can’t take this whole thing seriously,” Rob reasoned. “It’s kind of weird.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kim Kardashian also failed to see the value in Disick’s new title — and slammed her boyfriend Kanye West for indulging Disick’s silly demands. “Is this a joke? He is so delusional and full of himself,” Kim snapped of Disick, who went so far as to snub “commoners” at a nightclub appearance and deny them photos and handshakes.</p><p>Back in the States, Disick’s Lord act fell flat with his girlfriend of five years, Kourtney. When pregnant Kourtney wouldn’t cater to his every demand, Disick knew his jig was up.</p><p>Sniped Disick: “It’s clear I was a Lord in London, but it’s clear I’m not royalty in my own house!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOrJqorKRisaq%2FyJyiZpqVmLyusdJmmauhpJ7AqXnRqLCapKSueqix06xkpKaZnLW1scNmoKdlnKS7pbvNZmlpaWJmg3g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
