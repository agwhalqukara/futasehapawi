I ain’t throwing shots; it’s just is what it is… I’m just gonna’ remain classic.”&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, with all of the love Knight is often shown by her peers and loyal fanbase for her craft, she hasn’t been awarded many accolades to show for it. However, Knight doesn’t count her successes by the amount of awards she’s won, but by the fact that she’s able to trust God’s plan for her life.&nbsp;</p><p>“What God has for me is for me,” Knight said. “And it’s nothing, nobody or nothing, nothing can get in the way of that. And I keep my heart pure, I make sure that I put out good, you know, so I’m not blocking my blessings, and I trust what He got for me I’mma have it.”&nbsp;</p><p>The “Here I Go” rap star noted that she wants all that God has in store for her rather than what she personally wants for herself. Knight continued, “I want what he wants for me, not just what I want for myself, you know? So, I’m just good.”&nbsp;</p><p>While Knight may not have been given the opportunity to win a Grammy or Billboard award, she has been nominated for two BET Awards. In 2020, she even won the Detroit Music Awards for Outstanding Hip Hop Artist/Group.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout her time in the industry, fans have compared Knight to Dallas rapper Asian Doll, however, seemingly, neither woman has gotten distracted by the hearsay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Which Doll Makes Better Rap Music?</p><p>Kash Doll or Asian Doll 🤔? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/foYrMpgrdR</a></p>— Quinn | Journalist & Artist (@QuinnFos) <a href=#>February 13, 2023</a></figure><p>Knight might’ve gotten her start as a rapper, but she has managed to venture off into different categories such the role of actress.
