Earlier this year, the Prince gave an interview with BBC which was described as quite bizarre by many media figures.</p><p>Reportedly, due to Andrew’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, he has been kicked out of the royal family by his mother, Queen Elizabeth, and he now has to pay for his own lifestyle. Page Six claims that the queen formerly gave Prince Andrew an annual salary of £249,000, also tax-free.</p><p>Additionally, the ex-royal family member received around another 20,000 British pounds from his Royal Navy pension. An insider who spoke with the outlet claimed Andrew has seemed quite wealthy over the last few years, and it’s not entirely clear how he managed to come upon so much money.</p><p>David McClure, an author, said to the United Kingdom’s Press Association that it was unclear how Andrew was managing to accrue wealth. In the past, it was speculated by many figures that Andrew supplemented his lifestyle through his role as the UK’s trade envoy.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5QPVhhJu68/</p><p>He didn’t receive any direct money from the position, but he was often treated to luxury dinners from other members from different royal families and leaders of corporations. However, Andrew had to resign from the position in 2011 due to his relationship with the accused sex offender who allegedly killed himself.</p><p>Additionally, Andrew’s reputation was called into question for his meetings with autocrats from all over the world, including Muammar Gaddafi as well as Nursultan Nazarbayev. Four years ago in 2015, Andrew set up a dinner between the Queen and Nazarbayev at Buckingham Palace.</p><p>Furthermore, between 2001 and 2008, the Prince went to the UAE nine different times, including visits to Kuwait, Egypt, and Bahrain. The trips were typically paid for by British taxpayers. The Prince was supposed to be promoting British business, however, in 2005, the Trade Minister asked him to name a few contracts and he didn’t have any.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>In an interview with BBC recently, the Prince admitted that he hung around Epstein for access to other powerful people around the world. Andrew described his relationship with Epstein as helpful in many ways, including for the way in which he had access to many powerful people.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGegp7avr8RmmKecoprEtHnFoqWappOerq15xa6rrqqVYra0ecKao6WdlGK2r8DOZqiunaOptrC6jJ%2BmpaSfrLavs4yjnJ%2BeoprGbrHPrKueoZ5irqeywKKpZmtkaX93f44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
