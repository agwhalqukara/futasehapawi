"We don't have any room to be doing that at this point."</p><p>Michigan is preparing for the College Football Playoff national championship game against Washington, but distractions remain as the NCAA continues to investigate the program for alleged sign-stealing.</p><p>The Big Ten already suspended Harbaugh for three games to close out the 2023 regular season, but he has been back on the sideline since the conference championship game against Iowa.</p><p>The NCAA's investigation focuses on former Wolverines analyst Connor Stalions, who resigned from his position after being suspended. However, his resignation doesn't mean there won't be consequences for the program, and the vacating of wins has been speculated as a potential punishment.</p><p>While there has been a lot of noise off the field, Michigan is playing some of its best football in the Harbaugh era.</p><p>Quarterback J.J. McCarthy helped lead the Wolverines to a 27-20 overtime victory against Alabama in the Rose Bowl as the program clinched a berth in the CFP national championship game for the first time in history.</p><p>Michigan now has the opportunity to win a national title, but taking on Kalen DeBoer's Washington Huskies on Jan. 8 will be the team's toughest task yet. The Huskies boast the best offense in college football, and containing the likes of Michael Penix Jr. and Rome Odunze won't be easy.</p><p>That said, any concern about the possibility of vacating wins will be put off until after the final whistle of Monday's matchup against Washington.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGiBd4GMo6CmZZiWv6Ot1KCfZqeeYr2wv9KimaWxXZ2ut7XNoGSmoZOdtqitzWauoqajYsOir8CtnJ1lmWKxsLrTZqOirpVitq950a6kqKpdq7atuMQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
