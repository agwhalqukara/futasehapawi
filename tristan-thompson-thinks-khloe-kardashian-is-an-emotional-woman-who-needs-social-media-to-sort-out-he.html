Tristan knows that Khloe is a sensitive person, who is in touch with her emotions, and sharing those messages with fans is her way of opening up and letting others know they’re not alone.”</p><p>The insider went on to explain: “Khloe’s notes don’t necessarily mean that she’s going through those experiences at the time, but she’s simply sharing in order to connect with others and sees it as a way of bringing people together on a deeper level.”</p><p>Khloe recently sent tongues wagging after she shared this long message where she was buried deep in her feelings: “There will be some things you won’t get over. Some things that will sting you so hard, they will set you back to where you started. And you will hurt and hurt and hurt. But you will also rise from it. You will learn from the past. You will adapt and survive no matter how hard it gets. You will shape your own reality and accept how you should never settle for anything less you deserve.”</p><p>A source told Radar Online that Khloe’s sisters are fed up with her fake drama and added: “They are all tired of playing these games with Khloe and they know she has to be tired of it too. Khloe knows that Tristan is not the one for her and she is just with him because she is trying to save face for the sake of True.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Well, at least, all of the players involved know what is going on.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGekp7a0wMCnZK2gn6K9tLvNZquhoZ6gwG63x6WmnmWblr%2BlrdKhoJqmXZ7Abq3NZpymp6SevK%2Bty2auqKWRo3q4tM5mpZ6dlKh6tLvCopilZZ2asaqtjK2mZqufp8Fuu9StZKGdomKzprHLoqWgq12stq24jK2fnmWbqsS1t4ysq5qqXZyytXnAp56rsV1ngHqFkHFm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
