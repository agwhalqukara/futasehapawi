Brown will be a valuable trade asset on an expiring contract for the Raptors.</p><p>It comes as a bit of a surprise on a few fronts.</p><p>For one, the Raptors are clearly in a rebuilding mode after trading Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby last season. Building a core around players like Scottie Barnes, R.J. Barrett, Immanuel Quickley and Gradey Dick—alongside any incoming rookies at this year's NBA draft—is the logical move.</p><p>Two, keeping Quickley means paying up, and the restricted free agent intends to sign a five-year, $175 million contract with the franchise, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Wojnarowski</a>. And it's certainly fair to argue that Quickley—who played well in Toronto, averaging 18.6 points and 6.8 assists as the starting point guard—is a better allocation of financial resources than Brown.</p><p>Add in the pending free agency of Gary Trent Jr., and it wouldn't have been surprising if the Raptors had bigger financial priorities this offseason than Brown.</p><p>Three, it's fair to argue that Brown is now overpaid on his contract, regardless of the above. While the 27-year-old is a very solid role player who averaged 9.6 point and 2.7 assists in 34 games (11 starts) with Toronto, $23 million is a steep price to pay for a player who likely would have come off the bench.</p><p>By keeping Brown, the Raptors have less financial freedom in free agency or wiggle room to bring back a larger salary than they send out in a trade. It's possible that by keeping Brown, the team will have to move on from Trent.</p><p>The Raptors will have some important decisions to make heading into free agency. But one has already been made, with Brown sticking around—at least for the time being—on his player option.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWqAdoGMp5maZaKqurC%2B0maZq62Tmnqjvs6wpaxlYmi6bq%2FOp6urmZOperC806Kmp2WVrbKzr8isnJ1lkq56s63Praarq12WuqqwjK2pmpyVYq%2B2xtk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
