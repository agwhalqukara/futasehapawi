He picked up four birdies to help improve his score, but crushed his progress with two bogies and a double bogey on the back nine.</p><p>He showed improvement in Round 2, carding a one-over-par, but with Thursday's disastrous performance, he was far from the cut line.</p><p>Unlike Woods and Mickelson, Rahm is just out of reach of the projected cut line. Rahm finished Round 2 even at par, just one stroke away from advancing to Round 3.</p><p>Despite collecting five bogies in Round 1, Rahm managed to get to one-under-par due to six birdies. On Friday, he had a bogey and a birdie in the front nine and had two more birdies and a bogey on the back nine. He would have had enough to advance had it not been for a double bogey on the 17th hole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmaCc4OMqZ6aZZOdrq68yKilrKCZpXqkwdNmo6KmlWJ%2FcX6TZquin5Wneri7zp2qZpmemXqxvs6jnJyslZl6rbXSrWSonl2luaLFxKuqZqqVory3scM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
