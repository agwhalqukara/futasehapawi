Russian authorities have yet to establish a reason for the river’s unusual appearance, but local people quickly linked it to a giant metals plant upstream. Russia's Environment Ministry said it was investigating a plant leak as the likely cause.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Norilsk is known as one of the most polluted cities on earth, built around factories mostly belonging to the vast metals company Norilsk Nickel. Some Norilsk residents wrote in a local social media group that they believed the river’s biblical shade is linked to runoff from a nearby smelting plant.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Some suggested the color was being produced by wastewater mixed with mineral ore leaking into the river from the Hope Metals Plant.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The posts prompted Russia's Environment Ministry to respond, issuing a statement announcing that it is investigating and that preliminary information suggests the cause was a leak from waste pipes belonging to Norilsk Nickel. A company subsidiary denied the pollution was caused by an accident involving the Hope factory, according to the statement. The ministry said it is still working to locate the pollution's source.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Reached by ABC News, the factory declined to comment.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Area residents on social media and a local indigenous group said they were sure the color was coming from the area's metals plants, noting that it was not the first time they contaminated the region's water.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">A user named Evgeny Belikov, who claimed to have worked at the Hope plant, said that workers referred to a reservoir connected to it as the "red sea" on account of its color, produced by ore runoff.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Other users posted older photos seeming to show the reservoir a similar color in an area that has large pipes running into it.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"In winter, the snow's also red," Belikov wrote on the social media group. "On the one hand, it's beautiful, but on the other, it's chemical."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Grigory Dukarev of the Association of the Indigenous Peoples of the Taimir Peninsula, which represents native communities in the area, told ABC News that he was preparing to submit a formal complaint to regional authorities asking them to investigate and was traveling to the river to record the pollution.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">He said he was previously told that the runoff from the factories was not harmful and would cause minimal ecological damage. But he said he was skeptical.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">"I'm going to ask the representative from the company to drink this water," Dukarev said. "Will they drink this water? I doubt that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCVza2cq6aRqbawusClZquto6i2orqMq6CvnaJiurq%2F056poqelqLm6edOuqaerXZe5sLvDZqmenF%2BowbC%2B2HignXVkZoZygJFvZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
