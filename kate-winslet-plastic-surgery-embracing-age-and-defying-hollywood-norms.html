This scrutiny intensified when the movie Titanic made her a star, and some media outlets criticized her for being overweight at the time.</p><p>During a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">podcast appearance</a>, Winslet recently shared her feelings about those hurtful comments. She said, “Isn’t it awful? Why were they so mean to me? They were so mean. I wasn’t even fat.”</p><p>She also expressed that if she could go back in time, she would have responded differently to the negative remarks about her body and appearance.</p><p>She wished she could have told journalists, “Don’t treat me like this. I’m a young woman, my body is changing, I’m insecure, and I’m terrified. Don’t make this any harder than it already is. That’s bullying, you know, and borderline abusive.”</p><p>As Kate Winslet has grown older, she has become more confident in herself and her body. She’s decided to embrace the natural changes that come with aging, including wrinkles. She mentioned, “I have the kind of wrinkles that are here to stay now, not just the ones that disappear in a few hours. That’s how it is.”</p><p style=text-align:center><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Laura Loomer Plastic Surgery: A Closer Look at Her Surgical Transformations</a></strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebtransformations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/P2-4.jpg alt="Kate Winslet Plastic Surgery" width=1200 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Unlike some celebrities who opt for cosmetic procedures to fight aging, Winslet is determined not to go down that path. She believes it goes against her values and what she considers natural beauty. She stated firmly, “I will never give in.”</p><p>Surprisingly, even though she holds these beliefs now, there was a time when she was curious about cosmetic surgery. She once joked that her ex-husband, Sam Mendes, discouraged her from pursuing any such procedures, saying, “I am intrigued by surgery, but Sam would leave me if I did anything like that.”</p><p>Today, Kate Winslet is less preoccupied with her physical appearance. She’s found that health is more important than looking in the mirror or using beauty products. As she’s grown older, she thinks less about her appearance because she has more important things to focus on, like her family, happiness, and having fun.</p><p>While Winslet is content with her current look and attitude, not all Hollywood actors share the same perspective. Some turn to treatments like Botox, fillers, or facelifts to maintain a youthful appearance. Many in the industry keep such visits private, going to great lengths to avoid public attention and gossip magazines.</p><p>It’s refreshing to see Kate Winslet being open and comfortable with her appearance. However, the future may bring changes, and it remains to be seen if she will maintain the same attitude towards cosmetic procedures in the years to come.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8DRmqWsnp%2BnuqLAyKilrGaTpLpwt8CtnGavmaPArbHTZqelmaOptqR50q6poJ2irnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
