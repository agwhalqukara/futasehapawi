Communication is essential and very important in <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>interpersonal relationships</a> but sometimes it is hard to keep up a conversation, especially when you have run out of conversation starters. In this modern age and time, most people communicate actively over the phone through Facetime, phone calls, WhatsApp, Video calls, iMessage e.t.c. Coming up with what to talk about on Facetime, over the phone, or via text can make you to rack your brain if you are unprepared or have exhausted from the topics you had in mind, and in such times the conversation could take a boring turn.</p><p>So how do you know what to talk about over the phone or how do you keep a conversation on Facetime interesting and engaging? This article curates 60 different topics you can explore in your conversations either over the phone, via text, or on Facetime. But first, let us analyze some of the challenges of sustaining communication over the phone.</p><h2><b>Common Challenges Faced in Sustaining Phone Conversations</b></h2><p>It is indeed true that phones have helped the world of communication, we cannot imagine how difficult it was for people who lived in the centuries when phones did not exist, to communicate; especially lovers or friends who yearned to speak with each other. Imagine that all forms of communication lines are cut off today and we all had to go back to the times of letter writing and “birds bearing scrolls”; it will be a disaster. The importance of Phones and the ease of communication they afford us cannot be overestimated, but as with most things that have advantages; there are also disadvantages especially putting into consideration the adverse effects of decreased “physical” communication as a result of an overreliance on communicating over the phone.</p><p>It can be quite difficult keeping up with topics that enhance interest over the phone; here are some of the challenges you may encounter;</p><ul><li><b>Lack of body language:&nbsp;</b>One of the biggest challenges people face in over-the-phone communication is a lack of body language. Sometimes, a message is much more accurately passed when the people communicating can read each other’s body language. Body language is a luxury over-the-phone conversations cannot afford, and it makes optimal communication not readily accessible over the phone.</li><li><b>Misunderstandings: </b>Couples are much more likely to argue or misunderstand each other when they communicate over the phone. Certain words may not be conveyed properly which also boils down to the absence of body language. For example, Holding hands and saying Goodbye, feels different from saying Goodbye over the phone. It is easier to misunderstand certain words and tones of voice over the phone.</li><li><b>Stagnant conversations: </b>We all have experienced the awkward silence that can stretch over minutes when you run out of things to talk about, but this feels worse over the phone conversation, especially when you don’t know what else to talk about.</li><li><b>Phone Anxiety: </b>Not being able to figure out what the other person is thinking or feeling on the other side of the phone can create certain anxiety. And sometimes, some people do not fancy talking over the phone because they feel some certain kind of anxiety about phone conversations.</li><li><b>Fear of the unknown:&nbsp;</b>Not knowing the exact weather, environment, place, mindset, and setting on the other side of the phone conversation can spark a certain kind of fear and paranoia especially when discussing certain topics.</li><li><b>Running out of Topics:&nbsp;</b>It is much easier to run out of topics when talking over the phone than in physical conversations. It is also more difficult to figure out if the other party is still interested in the conversation or just acting along.</li><li><b>Awkward and long silences:&nbsp;</b>Awkward silences are a “thing” with over-the-phone conversations. Sometimes, people just keep listening to themselves breathe or stare at each other especially on face time and not knowing what else to say or do.</li><li><b>Pressure:&nbsp;</b>The pressure to say the right thing, in the right manner and in the right tone, in order not to create misunderstandings is ever-present in over-the-phone conversations. And honestly, some discussions are better in person than over the phone.</li><li><b>Network Reception Issues: </b>Especially in developing countries, Network reception and signals are a huge stumbling block for optimal over-the-phone conversations as signals can be disrupted without warning.</li><li><b>Distance: </b>Over-the-phone conversations between people who live in the same city and those who live on different continents; feel different. Especially for couples, it gets frustrating to keep on talking over the phone with a person that is so far away.</li></ul><p>From the aforementioned, the fulcrum of challenges that are faced in over-the-phone conversations is “Body Language”. The lack of body language affects a lot of things and deals differently with each different medium of the phone conversation. But, lack of body language should not kill your vibe, we are going to curate 60 different topics that you can talk about both on text, audio phone calls, and Facetime; to limit the effects of a lack of body language as well as minimize misunderstandings and pressure.</p><p>Additionally, Texting is different from Audio phone calls and also different from Video calls. You can text just about anybody but you can not Facetime just anyone; because despite the lack of body language, Video calls except for Formal meetings, are more intimate than texts or audio phone calls.</p><h2><b>Differences Between a Video, Audio, and Text Conversation&nbsp;</b></h2><p>As much as they are all over the phone conversation, Texts, Audio Calls, and Video calls are different; because the mode of delivery and reception for each of them is dynamic. Here are some highlighted differences;</p><h3><b>Audio Phone Conversation</b></h3><p>Audio phone calls have been in existence since the invention of the Telephone in the late 19th Century. They involve dialing a number, waiting for the call to be received and then you convey your message. The caller can’t see the receiver, the receiver can’t see the caller. Only voices and sounds can be heard. The advantage of an Audio phone call is that it is easier and more accessible and has been in existence for longer. Most people especially the older generation prefer Audio phone calls. Audio phone calls are also convenient and maintain privacy, in addition to the fact that they can be made or taken anywhere. They are much more universal because even in remote villages where there is no internet reception, Audio Phone calls can still be made. &nbsp;And as such Audio phone conversations are cheaper, much more convenient, and more accessible.</p><p>Voice notes are also a form of Audio phone conversation, but Voice notes require Internet services and a Social Networking Application.</p><h3><b>Text Conversations&nbsp;</b></h3><p class=p1><span class=s1>The First Text message, or properly put SMS (Short Message Service) was sent on the 3rd of December 1992. However, the concept of SMS was first developed in 1984 by a Franco-German GSM Cooperation. And so, conversations</span> via text message became rampant with the introduction of mobile phones, and then texting became “a thing” with the advent of Social Media and Social Networking sites. Text messages are convenient. Although the sender may not have an idea if his or her message has been received unless the receiver sends a reply or acknowledges receipt. Texts are also convenient for both Formal and informal conversations and can be sent any time and anywhere especially when a person is communicating discreetly.</p><p class=p1>Texts can also be sent via the internet(iMessage, Whatsapp, Emails, Messenger e.t.) or via network providers as good old SMS. If you are in a class and you want to convey a message to your friend across the hall without anybody finding out, you have to text. These days, smileys, stickers, and memes have made texting very interesting however, texts cannot wholesomely convey emotions optimally. Texting conveys Zero Body language.</p><p>Also, Texting is great for record-keeping, so whenever you need to recall a piece of particular information regularly, ask for the information to be texted to you.</p><h3><b>Video Conversation</b></h3><p>About 51 years ago, the first video call was made on 30th June 1970. But, Video calling or Video conversations became mainstream with the advent of smartphones. Video calls have become the thing as they have been extended to formal business meetings. Apps like Skype, Imo were&nbsp;amongst the pioneer video calling Apps, however; Facetime, Whatsapp, Zoom, Facebook Messenger,&nbsp;and many more Video calling Apps are now mainstream.</p><p>Apart from formal virtual meetings, Video calls are much more blended with informal conversation amongst friends, colleagues, lovers, and family. Video conversations make communication over the phone feel “closer” and more “intimate”, however Video conversations need the internet and will not work in remote areas without internet reception. Also, you can not face time or video call just about anywhere, unlike text messages.</p><p>Video calls require some form of permission as not just anyone can place a video call across to another person. For example, Facetiming is one of the most common ways lovers communicate, and a random colleague at work cannot just face time another colleague. So, because Facetime or Video conversations are not just for anyone, sometimes figuring out what to talk about on facetime, or how to keep the conversation going can be quite taxing.</p><h2><b>What To Talk About on Facetime and How to Make The Video Call Interesting</b></h2><p>So, what can you talk about on Facetime or any video call to keep it interesting? Here are some ideas.</p><h3><b>1. What you both can see at the moment</b></h3><p>It is Facetime and you both can see yourselves and your surroundings. Be spontaneous, talk about what you can see, his/her cloth, appearance, background items, surroundings, and a whole lot of other things. For example: <i>Your shirt is blending with the flower vase in your background, is it a coincidence? </i>This&nbsp;question/statement will open a lot of discussion on observation and immediate surroundings.</p><h3><b>2. Intimate Moments&nbsp;</b></h3><p>For lovers/Couples, facetime is a good place to re-live intimate moments. Talking about the last time you both cuddled up, or spent time with each other physically is a great topic for couples on facetime. Just make sure the time and place are right.

Rather wait for when you both are in your various rooms alone and resting.</p><h3><b>3. Catching Up</b></h3><p>For friends who have not seen each other in a while, catching up on all has been going on is top of the list of what to talk about on Facetime with your friends/friend.

Q and A Sessions</b></h3><p>A good old question and answer session is a great way to keep a conversation going.

A Rundown of the Day</b></h3><p>This is great for nighttime FaceTime conversation. Talking about the things that went on during the day, and all that went wrong or right.

It could be on a schedule, for example, you can set up weekly letting off steam sessions on Facetime on Fridays. Ask questions like; <i>How are you feeling? What do you think you should have done differently today? What bothers you the most? Tell me your greatest worries e.t.c. </i>This can be done with friends, family, a spouse/lover, or colleague(s).</p><h3><b>9. Game time on Facetime&nbsp;</b></h3><p>Thanks to technology, there are games you can play with your friend, family, or lover over FaceTime. You can’t go wrong with games like <b>Charades</b>; where you act like a person, animal, or an object and have the other party guess, <b>Battleship</b>; which is a computer game, <b>Read my lips;&nbsp;</b>where you mouth words without voicing them and have the other party guess correctly. These are all great ways to keep a video conversation interesting.</p><h3><b>10</b>.<strong> “Show Off”</strong></h3><p>Get to show off new assets, designs, décor, and talk about them. This also works for store owners.

Books</b></h3><p>A virtual book club is great for Facetime conversations. For book lovers, discussing new and old books is great for video conversations as you can both read from the book, analyze the book and even create a virtual book club that may eventually turn into a routine.</p><h3><b>12. Sleepover</b></h3><p>There is such a thing as virtual sleepovers over Facetime. This works very well for the group of friends who are far from each other. This was also one of the coping mechanisms during the quarantine period of the pandemic. This also works for kids. A Facetime sleepover is doing everything you usually do at a sleepover, only that this time everyone sets up their phones and does it virtually. Set up games, karaoke, songs, and all other fun ideas and if you are up to it, fall asleep with everyone’s phone still turned on.</p><h3><b>13.

Although the world is no longer under lock and key, you can talk about how you felt and how your friends or family felt during the quarantine period over Facetime. Re-live some of the activities, stories, and memories of that period. <i>How do you think you can cope with another lockdown? Do you miss anything about the quarantine period? What was your lowest and highest point during the lockdown?</i> These questions are great conversation starters.</p><h3><b>17. Love Languages</b></h3><p>Talking about the love languages with your partner is better felt over Facetime as you both look into each other’s eyes over your phone screen; as you talk about “<i>Acts of service, quality time, physical touch, words of affirmation and receiving gifts”. </i>If you both are in a long-distance relationship, talk about how much the lack of physical touch affects both of you and then affirm each other.</p><h3><b>18. Photo Gallery Discussion&nbsp;</b></h3><p>If you have interesting photos in your home, office, or phone, you can have a great time sharing the photos and talking about them over Facetime.

Old photos do more magic.</p><h3><b>19. Random Conversations</b></h3><p>Sometimes, perfection lies in simplicity. You can create the most interesting conversations from just about any random thing. So while you are thinking of what to talk about on FaceTime with your friend or partner, you can start talking about any random thing.

Your Relationship&nbsp;</b></h3><p>Looking into your spouse or lover’s eyes and having a heart-to-heart discussion over Facetime is a great alternative for couples in long-distance relationships who are not able to hold hands and cuddle and talk.
