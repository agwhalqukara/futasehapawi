How do you make Alabama cookies?&nbsp; Put them in a big bowl and beat for three hours.</p><p>9. It's reported that Nick Saban will only dress 20 players for the Tennessee game.&nbsp; The rest will have to dress themselves.</p><p>8. What does the average Alabama student get on his SAT score?&nbsp; Drool.</p><p>7. What did the Alabama graduate say to the Tennessee graduate?&nbsp; Welcome to McDonald's, may I take your order please?</p><p>6. An Alabama fan walks into the doctor's office one day with a hat on.&nbsp; He takes off his hat, and the doctor sees that there is a big frog sitting right on top of his head.&nbsp; The doctor looks at the man and asks him why he has a frog sitting&nbsp;on his head.&nbsp; It was the frog who replied "Actually doc, I was the one who wanted to see you. Can you remove this wart off my butt?"</p><p>5. Why should the University of Alabama change it's team name to the opossums?&nbsp; Because they play dead at home and get killed on the road.</p><p>4. Where was O.J. really hiding at right before the famous Bronco chase?&nbsp; On the campus at Alabama.&nbsp; He figured they would never find a real football player there.</p><p>3. What do you call a good looking girl on the University of Alabama campus? a Visitor.</p><p>2. What should you do if you find three Alabama fans buried up to their necks in cement? Get more cement.</p><p>And......The number one Alabama joke of all time is:</p><p>1. What do a maggot and an Alabama fan have in common?&nbsp; They can both live off of a dead bear for 20 years.</p><p>Haha.&nbsp; Sorry guys, it's all in good fun.&nbsp; As I stated above I expect to receive complaints from fans around the states, but it's ok. I have come to terms with it.&nbsp; Don't this just make you wish that we could skip all this March Madness crap and&nbsp;leap right past summer and get to the best time of year? College football.&nbsp; Where the men are men, and the truth shall set you free.&nbsp; Good luck this year all....ummmmm except for Alabama.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG1pYmeCbsDOqWRqaF2WuaKuwKaYZqKfoLK0ec6fZJqknGLBqrnEZpuopqRiv6atw2agn2WppMJurdGeZJ%2Bqn6J6orjAm5immQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
